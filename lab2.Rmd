## Part 1: PCA with penguins

```{r}
penguin_pca <- penguins %>% 
  select(body_mass_g, ends_with("_mm")) %>% # to select a column ending with "_mm"
  drop_na() %>% # in parenthesis can include specific variables to drop for instead of dropping all NAs
  scale() %>% # to scale the data 
  prcomp() # to run the PCA

penguin_pca$rotation

penguin_complete <- penguins %>% 
  drop_na(body_mass_g, ends_with("_mm")) # we created this subset to have a subset of the data without the NAs for the variables we're interested in, but still including the other variables which we might want to use in our plot

# autoplot will assume that we want a biplot for the PCA
autoplot(penguin_pca,
         data = penguin_complete,
         colour = "species",
         loadings = TRUE,
         loadings.label = TRUE) +
