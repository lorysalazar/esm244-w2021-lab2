```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(here)

# For PCA:
library(ggfortify)

#For ggplot customization
library(readxl)
library(gghighlight)
library(lubridate)
library(plotly)

# To make compound figures:
library(patchwork)
```

## Part 1: PCA with penguins

```{r}
penguin_pca <- penguins %>% 
  select(body_mass_g, ends_with("_mm")) %>% # to select a column ending with "_mm"
  drop_na() %>% # in parenthesis can include specific variables to drop for instead of dropping all NAs
  scale() %>% # to scale the data 
  prcomp() # to run the PCA

penguin_pca$rotation

penguin_complete <- penguins %>% 
  drop_na(body_mass_g, ends_with("_mm")) # we created this subset to have a subset of the data without the NAs for the variables we're interested in, but still including the other variables which we might want to use in our plot

# autoplot will assume that we want a biplot for the PCA
autoplot(penguin_pca,
         data = penguin_complete,
         colour = "species",
         loadings = TRUE,
         loadings.label = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal()
```


## Part 2: ggplot2 customization & reading in different file types

#### Read in an .xlsx file & do some wrangling

```{r}
fish_noaa <- read_excel(here("data","foss_landings.xlsx")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), tolower)) %>%# mutating columns across whatever columns are a character class, to lowercase
  mutate(nmfs_name = str_sub(nmfs_name, end = -4)) %>% # removes the last four characters from the values in that column; could also make a new column by saying nmfs_new instead of the same name
  filter(confidentiality == "public")
```

Make a customized graph:

```{r}
fish_plot <- ggplot(data = fish_noaa, aes(x = year, y = pounds)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = nmfs_name), show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal()

fish_plot

ggplotly(fish_plot)

### Use gghighlight to highlight certain series

ggplot(data = fish_noaa, aes(x = year, y = pounds, group = nmfs_name)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  gghighlight(nmfs_name == "tunas")
```
